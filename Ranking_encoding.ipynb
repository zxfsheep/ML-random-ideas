    "A common technique to deal with categorical features for non-deep machine learning models is one-hot encoding(For deep learning, they can be embedded in a vector space as in **Factorization Machines**). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this has some drawbacks in practice. For example, this creates a lot of sparse features if the number of categories is large, which can confuse the machine learning models. For tree based models, a common technique to overcome overfitting is to use a proper subset of features for each tree or level. In this case, too many sparse features can dilute the amount of useful information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular encoding is **mean encoding**, i.e. encode a category by its target mean. This however can still cause potential trouble, as categories with the same or very close target mean can be mixed together, but we still want to differentiate them as they might have very different interactions with other features. After all, the main goal of encoding is to encode, not providing correlation with target. The decision trees can find out the correlations automatically during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore I chose to encode all categorical features by their **rankings** of target mean, which is also a very nice application of pandas. In case of a tie, we just break the tie arbitrarily."
